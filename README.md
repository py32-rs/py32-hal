This HAL crates is the [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) framework driver for Puya microcontrollers.

This HAL crates uses the metapac approach to support multiple chips in the same crate.

The metapac is maintained in the [py32-rs/py32-data](https://github.com/py32-rs/py32-data) repository, published as a crate `py32-metapac`.

Keypoints:

- Embassy support
- All-in-one metapac for peripheral register access, check [py32-data](https://github.com/py32-rs/py32-data) for more
- All-in-one HAL crate, no need to create a new crate for each chip
- Async drivers, with async/await support, DMA (TODO)support
- Write once, run on all supported chips(should be)

## Supported Devices and Peripherals

Currently, supported chips are listed in `Cargo.toml` as feature flags.

Supported chip flags: py32f030f16, py32f030k28, More is coming...

others should work if you are careful as most peripherals are similar enough.In fact, the IPs of peripherals in different PY32 series may be consistent. Moreover, some series use the same die, so it might not require much work.

For a full list of chip capabilities and peripherals, check the [py32-data](https://github.com/py32-rs/py32-data) repository.

### TODOs

Too many...

## Minimum supported Rust version(MSRV)

This project is developed with a recent **nightly** version of Rust compiler. And is expected to work with beta versions of Rust.

Feel free to change this if you did some testing with some version of Rust.
