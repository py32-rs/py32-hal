# As of 2023-12-04, this driver is implemented using CC1 as the halfway rollover interrupt, and any
# additional CC capabilities to provide timer alarms to embassy-time. embassy-time requires AT LEAST
# one alarm to be allocatable, which means timers that only have CC1, such as TIM16/TIM17, are not
# candidates for use as an embassy-time driver provider. (a.k.a 1CH and 1CH_CMP are not, others are good.)
